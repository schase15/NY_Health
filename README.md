The `NY_mental_health` notebook explores the major diagnostic categories for hospital inpatient dischages in New York State in 2017. 

The data used can be downloaded from the New York State Health Department website [here](https://health.data.ny.gov/dataset/Hospital-Inpatient-Discharges-SPARCS-De-Identified/22g3-z7e7).

The findings of this exploration are discussed in my published article which you can read on my website: [Spotlight on Mental Health](http://steventchase.com/2020-04-03-mental-health/).

This article discusses the trends of hospital admissions based on age at a high level. Then, it takes a deeper dive into the mental health category.

The result is a PSA blog that hopes to educate the public in regards to the prevalence of mental health disorders across the state based on age group.
